PyAutoGalaxy Likelihood Function
==============================

The ``autogalaxy_workspace`` contains Jupyter notebooks describing the (log) likelihood functions used by **PyAutoGalaxy**.

The notebooks provide a step-by-step guide of how **PyAutoGalaxy** fits galaxy data, with the aim to make
the analysis clear to readers without background experience in galaxy modeling and make the modeling less 
of a "black box".

We recommend that when writing a paper using **PyAutoGalaxy** the author links to this GitHub repository when describing 
their likelihood function. 

The notebooks are not stored here (they are on the ``autogalaxy_workspace``), however URLs to every notebook are provided 
here. We recommend authors link to this GitHub repository (as opposed to direct links to each) because the 
URLs to notebooks on the ``autogalaxy_workspace`` may change after papers are published. 

By linking to this repository a permanent URL is provided.

There are different ways a galaxy can be modeled in **PyAutoGalaxy**, we provide links describing the likelihood
function of all approaches below:
